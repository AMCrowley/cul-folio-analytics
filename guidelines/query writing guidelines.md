## Query Writing Guidelines

This document describes guidelines for writing queries for the cul-folio-analytics
git repository. 

All canned reports developed for the CUL FOLIO Analytics repository are coded with "CR" 
followed by a 3-digit number and a short title with words separated by underscores, 
as shown in these examples:

* CR104 claims_returned
* CR123 open_orders
* CR130 fund_expenditures_by_po_line

Each canned query must be submitted with an associated README.md file. The README.md file 
documents the purpose of the query, lists the main tables used in the query, and provides 
instructions for using the query.

For creating, understanding, and revising LDP-based queries, please follow the guidelines
documented in the [QUERIES](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-analytics/edit/main/QUERIES.md) 
guide on the [FOLIO Analytics](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-analytics) repository. You 
can ignore the references to RedShift at the end of this guide, as we are not using this tool for the 
CUL FOLIO LDP reporting database at this time.
