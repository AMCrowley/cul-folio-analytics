AHR 114
Microforms Counts Details

This query was developed for the 2023 Olin Basement move project, and includes details of microform bibliographic information to help selectors make decisions about moving or de-accessioning the materials. It is a long-running query (15 + minutes). 
This query gets all microform records in a given library. Microform records are identified by looking in three places: the 007 field, call number, and title. 
The extracted elements sometimes show contradictory information for microform type; the query does not attempt to reconcile the differences.
This is a holdings-level query that counts item records attached to each holdings record. Note that many microforms do not have item records, so the item counts may show zero.
