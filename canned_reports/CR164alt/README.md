This is an alternative query to CR164 that counts e-resources by format through leader info. The leader information is thought to be less
accurate than the codes assigned locally bu CUL staff, but in FY22 counts 26K more resources. It is therefore used for a few overall e-resource
counts that don't divide e-resources by format. Contact Linda Miller for more info.
