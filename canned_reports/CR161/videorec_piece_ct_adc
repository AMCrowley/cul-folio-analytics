--vidrec_piece_ct_adc_20220624

--7/1/22 update: added sr.state  = 'ACTUAL' requirement to first subquery
--5/24/22 update: added item records must not be suppressed; added location translation table to query 4
--as query 5 is no longer working because we can't figure out how to translate the texts in the "number_of_pieces"
--field to integers. Instead, export the results of query 4 and get the sums of piece counts by 
--location through Excel. Note that there are null values for records created in FOLIO with only 1 piece (as no 
--piece count is addd unless there are more than one). These must be counted through an export of the fourth 
--table created.

/* These are the queries used by A&P to get the number of pieces of videorecordings currently held in 
 * Ithaca, by shelving unit, for CUL's annual data collection (adc). 
 * For the adc, these queries are run as close to the end of the fiscal year as possible 
 *(date filter not used here).
 *
 *The first 4 queries create local data tables stored in the "local_statistics" schema. They are
 *used by the fifth query to get counts of videorecordings currently held, by shelving location. 
 * 
 *Filtering requiring updates as needed:
 *Query 2: locations to be excluded (review as needed with CUL)
 *Query 4: how bound withs excluded will change over time (see documention in next row)
 *    Linda M: 11/29/21: I see from the updated LTS policy 
 *    https://confluence.cornell.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=403238522 that in FOLIO, item 
 *    records will not be created for other than the first title in a bound with. But it looks like
 *    there are some 200K FOLIO item records with “Bound with” for the enumeration that I assume came
 *    from Voyager (found just about the same amount in June 2021 in Voyager). I assume that in my 
 *    volume counts, I should continue to exclude item records with “Bound with” for the enumeration, 
 *    and that we won’t be cleaning up those records anytime soon?
 *    Laura D: 11/29/21: Yes, continue to exclude item records with “Bound with” for enumeration. I 
 *    believe we will be cleaning those up eventually, but I can’t imagine us doing so before the FOLIO
 *    bound-with solution is fully implemented. I can’t remember off the top of my head if that’s even
 *    got a release date yet, but it’s not Juniper or Kiwi.
 *Queries 5: update the adc_loc_translation_csv table as needed with CUL
 *
 *Once tables 1-4 are created by A&P for the annual report, a few earlier runs may be set aside
 *for later use, by adding dates to the end of the table names.
 */

/* Query 1: this query selects unique instance IDs and other instance info, including using the
 * subquery "get_date" to add the date of publication.
 * Stated quickly, it gets instance records whose bib format codes start with g or k; whose
 * type of visual material is v; that are not suppressed; and whose srs_records state is “actual”.
