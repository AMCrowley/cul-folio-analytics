CR 156
Historical Charges from Voyager

Provides a count of historical charges. Although it is possible to use filters such as location, call number, item type, item create date, material type, and Voyager bib ids, the filters in this report are hard-coded, as they are a complex set of filters. Please ask Joanne Leary for assistance.  Details at the item level are not available. Needs access to VGER data.
