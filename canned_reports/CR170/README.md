Item 'In Process" Status Report

This query was designed to show items that still have an "in Process" status, which may indicate that they were not properly discharged when they were received at the owning library (after being cataloged). Unless the items get discharged, the status will continue to show as In Process in the catalog, even though they have been shelved in the stacks.
