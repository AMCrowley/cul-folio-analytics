Ceased or Cancelled Serials

This report provides a list of ceased or cancelled serials, based on the specified location. Note that this query includes serials in the specified location as well as any Annex location. 

The query looks at both the receipt status and the holdings notes, includes Multi-part monographs for holdings type, and includes an additional receipt status of “Received and complete or ceased”. It shows the Annex holdings for those titles (where there are any) and sorts everything in call number order. 

NOTE: The resulting spreadsheet has to be edited to remove duplicate rows by deleting the effective_shelving_order column and then selecting Data/Remove duplicates.
