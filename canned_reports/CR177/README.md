Items in process

This report finds items with an 'In process' status. Typically, a newly cataloged book is sent to the owning library 1-3 days after being cataloged and bookmarked, where it is discharged, which changes the status from “In process” to “Available.” This report shows books that still have an 'In process' status (status date shown), which may be those that were received but haven’t been discharged before they were shelved. The only parameter is for owning library. The catalog link is shown to make it easy to view the display in the catalog.
