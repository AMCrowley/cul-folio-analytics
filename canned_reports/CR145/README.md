Equipment with holdings and checkout counts

This report shows all laptops and equipment for a given library, with total checkouts and renewals as of today's date.

NOTE: If the item was not checked out during Folio migration (if it had a status of available), then the count of checkouts prior to migration will not be included. This report contains only only post-migration checkouts.  

The report shows total checkouts and the number of renewals for each individual piece of equipment, and the current status, along with the date of this current status.
