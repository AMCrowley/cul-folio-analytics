Equipment with holdings, checkout counts, and statistical codes

This report shows all laptops and equipment for a given library, with total checkouts and renewals as of today's date.

NOTE: If the item was not checked out during Folio migration (if it had a status of available), then the count of checkouts prior to migration will not be included. This report contains only only post-migration checkouts.  

The report shows total checkouts and the number of renewals for each individual piece of equipment, and the current status, along with the date of this current status. It includes patron group name as well as stat codes to indicate whether the item has been archived or not.
