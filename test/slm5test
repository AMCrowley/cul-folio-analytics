--purchase order lines with no expense class

/*
This query gets fund and expense class from the po_lines table instead of the 
finance_transactions_purchase_orders derived table. When you create a PO, you can 
attach the fund and select an expense class. When you query POs from transactions, 
POs without transactions will not show, so expense classes created at the 
po_line level may not show. Fiscal year cannot be included because fiscal year 
is tied to transactions.
